* What is inflation?

    - Rate of increase in price of goods and servies over a given period of time 
    - slow and steady rise is good 2% per year
    - commonly used index
        - Consumer price index (CPI)
        - wholesale price index (WPI)

* Cause of inflation
    - Printing new money into circulation
    - legally devaluing the legal tendor currency
    - ? Loaning new money into existence as reserve account credits through the banking system by purchasing government bonds from banks on the secondary market

* Types of inflation
    - Demand-pull inflation
        - When there is increase in money supply → Overall demand of goods and services increase more than the production capacity → this leads to increase in price due to lack of supply  
    - cost-pull inflation 
        - When there increase in price or decrease in price of → raw-marterial or labour → overall cost of final product increase
    - Built-in inflation
        - As prices of goods and services increase → labour's wage expectations also increase → this cause prices of goods and services to increase 
        - this wages-price sprial continues

* Market Basket
    - market basket is fixed set of items in a given proportion used to track the inflation
    - The items i.e. goods and services changes from country to country depending on the demands of common household 

+ calculating CPI
    - measure of change in price of goods and services in market basket
    - CPI = (current_year_basket_value / base_year_basket_value) * 100
    - say base year to be 1950 so 
        year  | basket value    | CPI
        1950  : 1000            | -
        1960  : 1200            | 120
        1970  : 1400            | 140
        1980  : 1800            | 180
        
* Calculation of inflation
    - (new_CPI - base_CPI / base_CPI) * 100

* Legal Tender

    It is a form of money that the <b>courts of law</b> is required to recognises as satisfactory payment for any <b>monitary debt</b>.

# Monetarism

* According to this <b>supply of money in economy is primary driver of economic growth</b> 
* As avalibility of money increase 
    * aggregate demand of goods and service increase 
        * aggreagate demand of job creation increases 
            * reduce rate of unemployment  
                * this is economic growth

* Monitary policy is an economic tool used to control inflation 
    * It is implemented by adjusting interest rates and bank reserve requirements this inturn controls the money supply  
        * When interest rates are high people have less incentives to spend and more incentive to save
            * hence this controls the money supply

* Types of monitary policy
    * Contractionary / Decrease inflation
        * Increasing interest rates and limiting outstanding money supply 
            * Slows economic growth + decrease inflation
    * Expansionary / Increase inflation
        * during recession --> decreasing interest rates 
            * Saving become less attractive --> money flow increase

* Goals of monitary policy
    * Inflation --> Contactionary is used to decrease it 
    * Unemployment --> Expansionary monitary policy is used to reduce it
        * High money flow --> stimulates business and expansion of job market
    * Exchange rate --> with increase in money supply foriegn exchange rate becomes cheaper

* Tools of monetary policy 
    * Open Market Operations (OMO)
        * Central bank buys or sells bonds from/to investors to change number of outstanding securities with government and money availabe in economy as whole 
        * Buying bonds reduce money supply 
        * Selling bonds increses money supply
    * Interest rate 
        * Changing interest rate or required colletral
    * Reserve requirement
        * Central banks can change reserve requirement
            * It is the minimum funds that banks require to retain in proportion of deposites made

* Fiscal policy vs monetary policy
    
    It is an additional tool used to control inflation used by government and not by central banks.
    Government can create new money and implement new tax policies 

# Fiscal policy

* Variable private sector behaviour
    
        Private sector demand is too variable and depends on <b>psychological & emotional factor</b>
        Pessimism, fear, uncerntaity among consumers can lead to recession and dipression

* Corrective government fiscal action
    * When private sector decrease spending 
        * Govenment do tax cutting and government incresae spending 
    * When private sector increase spending 
        * Government increase taxes and decrease spending 

* Types of fiscal policies
    * Expansionary policy
