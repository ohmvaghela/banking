    - CPI = (current_year_basket_value / base_year_basket_value) * 100
    - say base year to be 1950 so 

        year  | basket value    | CPI

        1950  : 1000    <t>        | -
        
        1960  : 1200            | 120
        
        1970  : 1400            | 140
        
        1980  : 1800            | 180
